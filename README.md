## BlackJack Project
### Skill Distillery HW - Week 4

###Overview

This is a program that simulates a game of blackjack.  

The programs main calls the GameDriver class which handles most of the logic within the project.  

The other classes are mostly used to set up objects that are sent to the driver to deal with the logic of the game.


### Technologies Used

Object Oriented Java programming.


### Lessons Learned
(What was reinforced?)

Mostly how objects interact with each other.  Especially polymorphism since the hand and deck class could easily be repurposed for any other card game.  In other words they are not specific to blackjack.
